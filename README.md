# What the code should be
## Using the weather underground api and key:
- Create a Python application which will query multiple API endpoints from Weather Underground and present a weather summary to the user. When the user runs the application, he or she will be asked for a zip code, and the summary will be for that location.

- Summary should be printed to the screen, and must include the following:
- Current conditions at that location
- 10 day forecast for that location
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Any current weather alerts
- A list of all active hurricanes (anywhere)
